Advances in Financial Machine Learning Marcos

About the author:
Marcos Lopez de Prado ´ manages several multibillion-dollar funds for institutional
investors using machine learning algorithms. Over the past 20 years, his work has
combined advanced mathematics with supercomputing technologies to deliver billions of dollars in net profits for investors and firms. A proponent of research by
collaboration, Marcos has published with more than 30 leading academics, resulting
in some of the most-read papers in finance.
Since 2010, Marcos has also been a Research Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science), where he
conducts research focused on the mathematics of large-scale financial problems and
high-performance computing at the Computational Research department. For the past
seven years he has lectured at Cornell University, where he currently teaches a graduate course in financial big data and machine learning in the Operations Research
department.
Marcos is the recipient of the 1999 National Award for Academic Excellence,
which the government of Spain bestows upon the best graduate student nationally.
He earned a PhD in financial economics (2003) and a second PhD in mathematical
finance (2011) from Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Between his two doctorates, Marcos was a postdoctoral research fellow of RCC at Harvard University for
three years, during which he published more than a dozen articles in JCR-indexed
scientific journals. Marcos has an Erd´os #2 and an Einstein #4, according to the Amer- ´
ican Mathematical Society
